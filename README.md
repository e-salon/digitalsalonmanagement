# digitalsalonmanagement
This repository contains the original source code for a digital salon management system software.
Once completed the database web application will enable a person to locate nearby hairdressing salons/barbershops,
view the services offered by each salon,book the service of their choice and make advance payments.
On the other hand, the salon owner or salon manager will be able to list their services,manage bookings/appointments
and accept advance payments.
All services will be integrated for easier and efficient salon management.
